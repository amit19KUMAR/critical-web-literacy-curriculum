#Critical Web Literacy Module | Content Template - DRAFT

This template will help you draft activities for our Critical Web Literacy module. See [this lesson](http://chadsansing.github.io/curriculum-testing/intermediate-web-lit-two/session01-buttons-and-alerts.html#overview0) to check out how things are organized inside our curriculum modules. Please ask questions and make suggestions about how to improve the template using comments or suggestions.

Your tone should be conversational throughout and you should address the second person, or “you,” who will be the facilitator or leader of your lesson.

*You can also find [a copy of this template on Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rr3MDOcfigcidn33LlGIN_rZg2gGyaQonPWxHfPBbMM/edit#). Please cut and paste this version of the template or make a copy on Google Drive (File → Make a copy…) to begin a new draft of a lesson, delete the original writing, and then add your own.*

##Preparation
What should the facilitator do before teaching this lesson?

Include practical steps (e.g. “Try this linked activity on your own.”), as well as tips for facilitation and assessment (e.g. “Think about how to group your learners”).


##Introduction
This should be a brief section welcoming learners and providing step-by-step instructions for an ice-breaker or other activity that introduces the big ideas and concepts behind your lesson.

Learners should be able to play a game, make a model, or perform some kind of skit that lets them connect what they make to the skills they learn later in the lesson. Reflection and discussion can be part of the activity, but you should start by getting your learners to make or perform something.


##Offline Activity
This should be a set of step-by-step instructions for a minimally-resourced, offline activity that could be used nearly anywhere in the world to teach the web literacy skills in your activity.  You can use illustrations that are friendly to low-bandwidth settings. For example, your work in this section might include grayscale scalable vector graphics (svg) clipart instead of high-resolution images. Use https://search.creativecommons.org to search sites like Pixabay which have large libraries of openly licensed clipart you can search by type, many of which are in the svg format.

Ask yourself, How might learners in low- or no-bandwidth communities learn the same thing from this activity as learners in high-bandwidth communities?

This activity should connect back to the icebreaker learners did to make something connected to the skills addressed in this part of the lesson. It should be as accessible and localizable as possible.

Make sure to do the following:

- List alternatives for name-brand or specialized materials (e.g. “paper” rather than “sticky notes” or “Post-Its.”).
- Create and link to minimally illustrated printable resources.
- List simple, easily-sourced materials that can be reused.
- Invite facilitators to localize the work and improvise local materials and methods.

Steps in this activity will appear together as one larger “step” in the entire activity.

##Online Activity
This should be a set of illustrated, step-by-step instructions walking facilitators and learners through the online activity included in the lesson. You can make your own illustrations or use https://search.creativecommons.org to help find them. Low-resolution illustrations are generally better for a global audience than high-resolution ones. It’s fine to include videos, but not everyone will be able to access or share them. You can also make animated .gifs as alternatives to videos when it makes sense to do so with services like [GifMaker](http://gifmaker.me/).

This activity should connect back to the icebreaker learners did to make or perform something connected to the skills learned in this part of the lesson. It should be as accessible and localizable as possible.

Steps in this activity can be broken down into smaller, separate steps in our navigation bar. You can use headers to indicate where a new step begins. Try to keep each step as brief and clear as possible. You can look back to this example lesson to get a feel for how activities and steps are organized.

Provide links to external resources (such as [Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org) projects) and examples of work for learners to follow, if available.

##Reflection
Include a section with questions for discussion about what worked, what didn’t work, and what people learn from your activity.

Suggest questions that help learners summarize what they did and give learners a chance to offer suggestions about how the lesson can be improved.

You can also include lightweight assessment guidelines in this section to share with facilitators and learners (e.g. “You can assess learners’ responses as a form of self-assessment and ask them to back-up their statements with examples from their work”), but make sure that you encourage facilitators to assess learners’ work fairly and justly. Any assessments should be accessible to diverse range of learners and concentrate on critical web literacy rather than, say, the quality of a single learner’s writing.
