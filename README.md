# critical-web-literacy-curriculum
This is a repo for developing Mozilla's critical web literacy curriculum module with help from community co-designers.

The goal of this curriculum is to create compelling, relevant, and localizable critical media literacy lessons for use online and off. Co-designers will pay special attention to scaffolding offline activities for low- and no-bandwidth communities that teach the same concepts and skills as complementary online activities in each lesson.

This project should run from July, 2016, through January, 2017, culminating with the publication of a critical web literacy curriculum module on [https://learning.mozilla.org/activities](https://learning.mozilla.org/activities).
