# critical-web-literacy-curriculum
This is a repo for developing Mozilla's critical web literacy curriculum module with help from community co-designers.

The goal of this curriculum is to create compelling, relevant, and localizable critical media literacy lessons for use online and off. Co-designers will pay special attention to scaffolding offline activities for low- and no-bandwidth communities that teach the same concepts and skills as complementary online activities in each lesson.
