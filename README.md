# critical-web-literacy-curriculum

##Description
This is a repo for developing Mozilla's critical web literacy curriculum module with help from community co-designers.

##Goal
The goal of this curriculum is to create compelling, relevant, and localizable critical media literacy lessons for use online and off. Co-designers will pay special attention to scaffolding offline activities for low- and no-bandwidth communities that teach the same concepts and skills in the related online activities in each lesson.

##Team
More soon.

##Timeline
This project should run from July, 2016, through January, 2017, culminating with the publication of a critical web literacy curriculum module on [https://learning.mozilla.org/activities](https://learning.mozilla.org/activities).
